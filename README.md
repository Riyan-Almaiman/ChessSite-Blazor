# ChessSite-Blazor

Using the logic I wrote in my console chess app to write a web app with Blazor.

you can try it here https://shtranj.azurewebsites.net but I should emphasize it's very much a WIP, especially the UI and the join/create logic because there is no database and it uses the in-app memory and the tier I used on azure for some reason doesn't keep track of the singleton idk why
